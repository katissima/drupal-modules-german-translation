This is the German translation of Drupal.

If you have any comments, criticism or suggestions, please file a bug
at http://drupal.org/project/de or discuss them on #drupal in IRC.


Information for translators
===========================

# There are three different types of placeholders:
  * %placeholder: The string is wrapped in a theme_placeholder()
    (em tags by default). Also, it's piped through check_plain() to
    prevent XSS.
  * @placeholder: The string is piped through check_plain() to prevent XSS.
  * !placeholder: The string is returned as it is.
  
  You should be careful when updating the translation to correctly replace
  those placeholders.

# Be careful, a lot of *fuzzy* strings have sentences removed or added
  or <p> tags removed.

# Typographical notes
  * If a placeholder begins with %, don't wrap it in curly quotes. Also,
    remove curly quotes from all % placeholders.
  * Generally don't wrap any placeholders in quotes if it's not wrapped in the
    original string.
  * **Use curly quotes instead of the "inch" signs**: „Wort“ and ‚Wort‘
  * For apostrophes, use ’ instead of the plain '.
  * For dashes, use either the regular dash: -, the en dash: – or the
      em dash —.
  * For an ellipsis, use ….

# Stylistic advice
  * Never use informal language.
  * Try to avoid using "Sie" or "Ihr" by rephrasing the sentence, e.g.:  
      "Do you really want to delete %placeholder?" becomes
      "Soll %placeholder wirklich gelöscht werden?".  
    If passive constructions or other stylistic methods to avoid a direct
    address are too complex or sound weird, you can use "Sie" or "Ihr".
    Remember to always write them with a capital first letter.
  * Don't clutch at a direct translation. Sometimes you just can't translate
    an English expression in German without paraphrasing it. Also, the English
    version is not always written in a good style.
